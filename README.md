# U.S. Forms System

The US Forms System is an open source library and set of guiding principles for building complex web-based forms using [React](https://reactjs.org), the [JSON Schema standard](http://json-schema.org/), and the [US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/).

***THERE IS NO ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT ON THIS PROJECT. AT THIS TIME, THE CODE IS NO LONG BEING PATCHED OR UPDATED.***

### About this project

Inspired by Mozilla's [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form) library, the US Forms System is specifically intended for consistently styled governmental web-based forms. This library enables you to describe form fields in a JSON Schema configuration file, which then renders the backing React components necessary to build your form. You'll build forms significantly faster than existing methods, and benefit from the US Web Design System's best practices in user experience and data collection, validation, and transmission.

### Using the library

For information about setting up and using the US Forms System, see the *[US Forms System Documentation](./docs/README.md)*.

Additionally, the [US Forms System Starter App](https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system-starter-app) provides the basic files and configuration needed to get started building a form using the US Forms System.
