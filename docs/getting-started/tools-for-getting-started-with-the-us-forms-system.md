### General development tools and knowledge

To successfully create a form, the US Forms System requires some basic knowledge of these tools and concepts:

- **Command line tools:** You should be comfortable using command line tools such as Terminal (Mac and Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows). These tools come pre-installed on nearly all computers. There are several tutorials of various types available online to learn about the CLI.
- **Integrated development environment (IDE):** You may be most successful with an IDE such as [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). These IDEs also install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- **Package manager:** To easily install some tools listed below, install a package manager like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (Mac) or [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) (Windows).

### Laungauges and technologies

The US Forms System uses these languages and technologies within the library itself.

##### JavaScript

Most technologies the US Forms System uses, such as React, are centered around JavaScript. We recommend basic familiarity with JavaScript to build forms with the US Forms System. For more information about JavaScript, including tutorials for getting started, see [Pluralsight's JavaScript website](https://www.javascript.com/).

##### Node.js and npm

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to execute complete JavaScript programs. When you install Node.js, it automatically installs a package manager called npm. You need both Node.js (minimum version 8.0.0) and npm to develop using the US Forms System. For more information, including installation instructions, see the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org).

##### React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI). For more information, including tutorials for getting started, see the [React.js website](https://reactjs.org/).

##### JSON Schema

JSON Schema is a concise method of describing JSON data. We recommend basic familiarity with JSON Schema to build forms with the US Forms System. For more information about JSON Schema, see [Understanding JSON Schema](https://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/) by the Space Telescope Science Institute.

##### react-jsonschema-form (rjsf)

rjsf is a React component maintained by Mozilla that's used to build web forms based on JSON Schema. For more information, see the [react-jsonschema-form documentation](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form#react-jsonschema-form).
