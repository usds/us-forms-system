### [About the React component hierarchy](about-the-react-component-hierarhcy.md)

The US Forms System builds a React application of a form, and determines which React components to render based on the description of the form in the form configuration file.

### [Creating custom fields and widgets](creating-custom-fields-and-widgets.md)

You can customize the base library to satisfy the unique requirements of your particular form.
