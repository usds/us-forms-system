### Form instructions

This widget allows you to provide important information, warnings, or step-by-step instructions to users before they fill out a form.

![Instructions for an example healthcare benefits form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/usds/us-forms-system/images/Instructions.png)

#### What's available and where?

Note: This component is in the Starter App, not the library itself. It is a React component that you include by setting the `formConfig.introduction` property to a reference to that component. Edit the HTML inside the component to change the content.
```js
import Introduction from '../components/Introduction.jsx';

const formConfig = {
  …
  introduction: Introduction,
  …
};
```

- https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system-starter-app/blob/master/js/components/Introduction.jsx

### Form footer

This widget appears at the bottom of every page of the form (if it has multiple pages).

![A form footer that lists phone numbers to call for help](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/usds/us-forms-system/images/Footer.png)

#### What's available and where?

This component is not required. To define footer content, create a React component that renders HTML to act as a footer. The starter app does not include a footer, but the design of this component would be very similar to the Introduction component that the starter app contains.
```js
import Footer from '../components/Footer.jsx';
const formConfig = {
  …
  footer: Footer,
  …
};
```
Implementation: [FormApp.jsx](https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system/blob/master/src/js/containers/FormApp.jsx)

### Progress bar

This widget indicates to the user where they are in the process of the form. It includes a non-interactive, sectioned progress bar, a number to indicate how many pages there are within each section, and a title of that section. This progress bar is for a multi-chapter or multi-page form. It calculates the number of chapters completed and displays them in a horizontal stack of blocks. A progress bar is not recommended for single-page forms.

![A progress bar indicating that three of six parts of a form are completed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/usds/us-forms-system/images/Progress-Bar.png)

#### What's available and where?

In the `formConfig`, define your form's chapters and the pages contained inside each chapter. To add a progress bar to a multi-page form, create chapters with a single page each. *US Forms System contains the Progress Bar by default so it will display automatically when the chapters and pages are defined. If you do not want it, edit the FormNav.jsx component to remove the `SegmentedProgressBar` defined in the HTML.*

To add a progress bar to a multi-page form, create chapters with a single page each.

Implementation: [FormNav.jsx](https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system/blob/master/src/js/components/FormNav.jsx) and
[SegmentedProgressBar.jsx](https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system/blob/master/src/js/components/SegmentedProgressBar.jsx)

### Title and Subtitle

The name of the form. The form number should be specified in the Subtitle widget. In US Forms System, the subtitle ideally represents the form number. It appears near the form title.

#### What's available and where?

Define the form's title and subtitle in `formConfig`:
```js
const formConfig = {
  …
  title: 'Apply for Health Care',
  subtitle: 'Form 10-10EZ',
  …
};
```
- Implementation: [FormTitle.jsx](https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system/blob/master/src/js/components/FormTitle.jsx)

### Date

A date picker (with validations).

![A form date selector widget with June 8, 1995 selected](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/usds/us-forms-system/images/Date.jpg)

#### What's available and where?

Define these fields in the `schema` and then reference them in the `uiSchema`. Date field definitions are in [date.js](https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system/blob/master/src/js/definitions/date.js), [dateRange.js](https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system/blob/master/src/js/definitions/dateRange.js),
[currentOrPastDate.js](https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system/blob/master/src/js/definitions/currentOrPastDate.js),
[monthYear.js](https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system/blob/master/src/js/definitions/monthYear.js),
and [monthYearRange.js](https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system/blob/master/src/js/definitions/monthYearRange.js).

```js
import currentOrPastDate from '../definitions/currentOrPastDate.js';
const formConfig = {
  …
  schema: {
    type: 'object',
    required: [ 'serviceDate' ],
    properties: {
      serviceDate: 'string'
    }
  },
  uiSchema: {
    serviceDate: currentOrPastDate('Service Date'),
  }
  …
};
```

### Alerts

Alerts are included automatically in fields that include validation. Taken from USWDS, alerts appear in several color variations, with or without icons, to indicate a warning, an error, or contextual information.

#### What's available and where?

For examples of how alerts are used, see https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system/tree/master/src/js/widgets.

### Hidden contextual information

This feature hides contextual information so that the user can opt to see the information only if needed.

![Two questions, one with contextual information hidden and one with information shown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/usds/us-forms-system/images/Contextual-info-hidden.jpg)

#### What's available and where?

#### What's available and where?

Define this in the data definition in the form config file.

### Contextual error message

This indicates to the user that they have either not filled out a required field or they have not done so within the form's parameters. You can set a custom error message to help the user progress with the form.

#### What's available and where?

This must be defined in the form config file.

### Review page

When you build a form with more than one chapter (shown by the segments in a progress bar), the review page lets users edit all of their entered form data without having to go back one page at a time.
