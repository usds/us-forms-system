## Getting started

There are two options for how to start using this library.

### 1: Start a new application

If you are starting a completely new application from scratch, the easiest way to get started is to use our [us-forms-system-starter-app](https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system-starter-app). This sets up the initial files, configuration, build process, and web server so you can start building the form immediately. Please refer to the set up instructions in that repo.

### 2: Install in an existing application

If you are installing the library into an existing application, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the library: 
`npm install --save https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system.git`

2. Install peer dependencies

There will be a few files you will need to configure in order for the form to work. The best reference for understanding what files you will need to create is our [us-forms-system-starter-app](https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system-starter-app).
